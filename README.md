# This repo stores the code for the contact form which is used on the Milk and More website

The web form has been written to use the 'requests' API and submits and creates a new ticket after all fields are completed. 

**Method**
The code has been written using ECMA script 5.1 in line with the Sandboxed javascript here: https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/templates/sandboxed-javascript

The code is inserted onto the page using Google Tag Manager and is executed upon page initialisation. There is a single function called loadElementForm which stores all of the Javascript and functions needed for the form to render and submit.
